The following is the base code that handles the Sound System in both of my games. It's extremely versatile, with support for nearly any common sound need in a game- such as fading sounds in and out,
layered sounds (for dynamic music etc..), playing sounds at random pitches and so forth. I've chosen this as it makes use of Scriptable Objects to make it extremely easy to add and tweak sounds in engine,  
as well as for its 'plug and play' nature which has allowed me to utilize it in both of my main games with almost no tweaks at all.
