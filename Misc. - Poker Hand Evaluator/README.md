# Personal Project: Poker Hand Evaluator 

I first wrote this poker hand evaluation code for fun in C++, but later adapted it to C# for use in a small poker game prototype I was making with some friends. The design challenge from a technical perspective was to create an algorithm that could take in a hand of (5+) card poker and return an integer score that would allow the comparison of any two poker hands just using basic operators >/</=. The general approach involves first delineating the 'rank' of your hand into tiered score brackets (I used multiples of 1 million) such that any '3 of a kind' hand (3 million) will always beat a 'pair' (2 million) and so on. Once this is determined (using a histogram of the ranks of cards in your hand), each individual card can then be scored based on their relative strength in situations where two players have tied hand ranks. Each type of hand has its own algorithm for determining this- for example, ties between straights can always be determined by comparing the rank of each straight's highest card. Overall this was a fun problem to solve that contained many micro problems within it, and I had to employ a number of clever tricks to solve them.
